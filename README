ViSP-images contains some images, image sequences and cad models
useful to run the ViSP example or test programs.

ViSP (ViSP states for ``Visual Servoing Platform'') is a modular
software that allows fast development of visual servoing
applications. Visual servoing consists in specifying a task as the
regulation of a set of visual features. ViSP is avalaible from
http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp

The most recent version of ViSP-images is available on ViSP download web page:
http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/download.html

To know which are the new data introduced in ViSP-images see ChangeLog.

To use ViSP-images in conjunction with ViSP examples or tests, you can
either set the VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH environment variable
(recommended) or precise the location of ViSP-images through the
program's -i command line option.

Below, we suppose that ViSP-images directory is installed in
<my directory>/ViSP-images

1. Setting VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH environment variable
1.1. On Unix platforms

Depending on your shell you can set VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH by:

  setenv VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH <my directory>

or by:

  export VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH=<my directory>

1.2. On Windows platforms

You can create an C:\autoexec.bat file in which you have:

  SET VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH=<my directory>


2. Using program's -i command line option

Most of ViSP test or example programs are using command line
options. If these programs need images, sequences or cad models
located in ViSP-images, you can use the -i command line option to
precise the location of ViSP-images.

Here an example:
Suppose that ViSP is installed and compiled. Thus you have build 
<ViSP>/test/images/testConversion executable.


%<ViSP>/test/images/testConversion -h 

  Show the program usage.

%<ViSP>/test/images/testConversion -i <my directory> 

  Will run testConversion on images located in <my directory>/ViSP-images
